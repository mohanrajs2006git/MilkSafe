## Introduction

Milk spoilage leads to massive wastage and potential health risks due to microbial contamination, especially in rural collection centers lacking real-time monitoring tools. This project presents **MilkSafe**â€”a smart, real-time monitoring system using IoT and machine learning to track freshness and alert before spoilage.

## Overview

The MilkSafe system uses:

- ESP32 microcontroller
- E201-BNC pH sensor
- MQ-135 gas sensor
- DS18B20 temperature sensor

Data is collected and transmitted for analysis. A trained ML model predicts spoilage time, and results are shown on a user-friendly dashboard.

## Goals and Objectives

ðŸŽ¯ Monitor gas levels, pH, and temperature in real-time  
ðŸŽ¯ Predict spoilage using machine learning  
ðŸŽ¯ Provide freshness classification: Fresh / Warning / Spoiled  
ðŸŽ¯ Alert users early to avoid health hazards and wastage  
ðŸŽ¯ Reduce post-harvest dairy loss through smart intervention

## Target Audience

- Dairy farmers
- Milk collection centers
- Dairy processing units
- Rural cooperatives
- Researchers and innovators in food safety

## Key Features

ðŸ“Œ Real-time sensor monitoring via ESP32  
ðŸ“Œ Freshness prediction using Random Forest algorithm  
ðŸ“Œ Visual dashboard displaying sensor trends  
ðŸ“Œ Classifies samples as Fresh, Warning, or Spoiled  
ðŸ“Œ Low-cost, portable, and easy-to-use hardware system
